### Ideas for Improvement of the Frontend

1. Using **Typscript instead of Javascript** in react (better development experience, but still less support for ReactTS over ReactJS)

2. Definitely using **React Redux** (or some other state management library) - especially for the admin pages

3. Finding a solution to *display pdf's** rather than with "react-pdf" (and "pdf.js"). Currently only these two make up 59% of my bundle size ...
