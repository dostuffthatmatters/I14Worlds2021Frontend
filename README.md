### Technology Stack

* **Frontend: [React (JS)](https://reactjs.org/)**
* **Backend: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)**

<br/>

* **Using the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) Pipline**
* **Hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/de/)**

<br/>

* **File Storage with [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/products/storage)**
* **SQL Database by [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)**

<br/>

* **Design Guideline by [Google Material](https://material.io/)**
* **React Design Components by [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)**
* **With the help of [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)**

### Ideas for Improvement of the Technology Stack

1. Using **Typscript instead of Javascript** in the whole Frontend

2. Switching **from Heroku Postgres to a more independent SQL Storage** solution (more
independent from the heroku pipeline). Maybe Google Cloud SQL (I don't really +
need the flexibility of NoSQL in this project right now.)

3. Maybe hosting the whole app on the Google Cloud instead of using
the Heroku pipline. More control, but also more effort.
