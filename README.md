### Ideas for Improvement of the Frontend

1. Using **Typscript instead of Javascript** in react (better development experience, but still less support for ReactTS over ReactJS)

2. Definitely using **React Redux** (or some other state management library) - especially for the admin pages

3. Building my own datepicker or better haveing just a select-drop-down -> Save 15% (95KB unpacked) of the current bundle size

4. Using Preact instead of React -> Save almost 20% of current bundle size AND faster application
