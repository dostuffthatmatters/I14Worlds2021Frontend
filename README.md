### Ideas for Improvement of the Frontend

1. Using **Typscript instead of Javascript** in react (better development experience, but still less support for ReactTS over ReactJS)

2. Definitely using **React Redux** (or some other state management library) - especially for the admin pages

3. Maybe using **Preact** to make the app faster (especially improve loading times)

4. Increase the use of lazy loading of used libraries

5. Building my own datepicker or better haveing just a select-drop-down -> Save 15% (95KB unpacked) of the current bundle size
