# Small Changes Left to Make

This is a collection of all the things that are left to change. Just 
small stuff (e.g. some style modifications on different vieports).

* Use something like history.popstate() for the custom back-icons
instead of them being a link to the next higher level page

* Image Slider: When aspect ratio of image matches the aspect 
ratio of the screen to a certain degree the three control 
buttons overlap with the image card

* Redirect routes like "/gallery/1/ed" or "/gallery/ed" to dedicated 
404 page

* Maybe build my own datepicker or just a select-drop-down. Currently 
the material datepicker makes up 7.3% of the total bundle size. And in
addition to that "date-fns" makes up 7.2%. So i could definitely save 
a lot here (95KB uncrompresses JS).
