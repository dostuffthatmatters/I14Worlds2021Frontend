# Small Changes Left to Make

This is a collection of all the things that are left to change. Just small stuff (e.g. some style modifications on different vieports).

* Change the images 2 and 3 ("AR One" and "Group Shot") to smaller 
versions on mobile (no need to download 2800px on mobile)

* More narrow lines in Footer (copyright, etc.) on mobile

* Image Slider: When aspect ratio of image matches the aspect 
ratio of the screen to a certain degree the three control 
buttons overlap with the image card
